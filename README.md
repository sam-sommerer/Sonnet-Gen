# Sonnet-Gen
NAACL 2022: Zero-shot Sonnet Generation with Discourse-level Planning and Aesthetics Features [https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.262/](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.262/)

- Step 1 - Keyword generation
- Step 2 - Rhyme word generation
- Step 3 - Add simile and imagery
- Step 4 - Decoding

A few notes:
- Both step 1&2 are located in the keyword folder. 
- To directly use the pretrained model, run inference_bart_keywords_gen.ipynb and load the model from [https://huggingface.co/FigoMe/sonnet_keyword_gen](https://huggingface.co/FigoMe/sonnet_keyword_gen). Then at decoding time, load the pretrained model from [https://huggingface.co/FigoMe/news-gpt-neo-1.3B-keywords-line-by-line-reverse](https://huggingface.co/FigoMe/news-gpt-neo-1.3B-keywords-line-by-line-reverse)
- To train the keyword model yourself, run train-keywords-bart.ipynb (we shifted from T5 to bart)

## Villanelle Notes
- `keyword/inference_bart_keywords_gen.ipynb` contains code to generate keywords
- `keyword/generate_rhyme.ipynb` contains code to make lines rhyme
- Look at `decoding.ipynb` or `demo/decode.py` for examples of how to decode
  - `generate.py` seems to be a copy of the two above, safe to ignore
  - Villlanelles have no restraints on pentameter, can get rid of those checks
- Ignore `keyword/get_keywords.py` and `keyword/train-keywords-bart.ipynb`/`keyword/TrainKeywords.py`

## Changes made

Note this is a high-level description of the most salient changes made to the repo. Many minor changes that were
nonetheless crucial for villanelle generation have been elided for brevity's sake. Additionally, significant time
and effort was put into getting the existing code in the forked repo to work as is before any work was done on 
villanelle generation. The existing code was extremely buggy and nonfunctional, but those changes have been elided
here as well.

- Create `generate_poem.py`: One file that combines keyword generation, rhyming, polishing, and final poem generation
- Create `gen_utils.py`: Contains utility function that converts keywords in string form to list form
- Create `decode.py`: Copied `demo/decode.py` into root and worked from there. Significant changes were made to this
  file, including:
  - Add `gen_villanelle()`. This function enforces the structure of villanelles
  - Remove syllable/phoneme restrictions
  - Fix scope issues stemming from `__name__ == "__main__"`
  - Additional minor changes to ensure code runs
  - Function to be called by `generate_poem.py` to generate final poem
- Create `keyword_gen/inference_bart_keywords_gen.py`: Modified from `keyword_gen/inference_bart_keywords_gen.ipynb`
  - Add `clean_keywords()`. Use regex to clean up/reformat keywords generated by model
  - Add `create_villanelle_keyword_masks()`. Because villanelles have repeating lines, the masked prompts passed into
    the model need to reflect that
  - Add `generate_keywods()`. Generate the first tercet keywords using model first. Pass this into `create_villanelle_keyword_masks()` to 
    create a masked prompt that contains repeating lines in the appropriate positions instead of masks. Pass this input
    into the model to fill in masks and get keywords
  - Fix scope issues stemming from `__name__ == "__main__"`
- Create `keyword_gen/generate_rhymes.py`: Modified form `keyword_gen/generate_rhyme.ipynb`
  - Add `make_repeating_lines_rhyme()`. This function is needed to ensure that every repeating line rhymes with each
    other **and** that each set of repeating lines are still identical with one another
  - Modify `generate_rhymes()`. We encountered issues with the CMU pronunciation dictionary python module that is used
    to find rhyming words given a source word. For instance, the module claims that there exist no words that rhyme with
    the source word "beautiful", which is clearly false. To remedy this, if the module finds no words that rhyme with a 
    given source word, then that source word is replaced with a default source word that is known by the module to have
    rhyming words
  - Fix scope issues stemming from `__name__ == "__main__"`
- Create slurm scripts in `slurm/jobs`: Using HPC gpus to generate poems efficiently
